        <h1>NEWLY RELEASED</h1>
        <p>Two of DC Comics' top Batman creators have just announced brand-new series starring their respective versions of The Dark Knight, both set to launch in 2022. On Wednesday, the publisher revealed that both Batman: White Knight creator Sean G. Murphy and Batman and Batman/Catwoman writer Tom King will be returning to the Caped Crusader next year with two very different takes on the character, one of which will bring Terry McGinnis into a whole new world. 

            Murphy's next Batman adventure will be a return to the White Knight universe that began with Batman: White Knight and continued with Curse of the White Knight and White Knight Presents: Harley Quinn, all part of DC's adult-driven Black Label imprint. Titled Batman: Beyond the White Knight, the eight-issue miniseries will be written and drawn by Murphy, and will feature Batman Beyond himself, Terry McGinnis, leaping into the White Knight universe 10 years after Bruce Wayne wound up in prison. 
            
            </p>
            <p>The White Knight universe began with the premise that Jack Napier, aka The Joker, had reformed himself and set out to become Gotham's new savior, while attempting to convince everyone that Batman was the city's true greatest villain. From Harley Quinn to Azrael the alternate universe has gone through a lot of reinvention of Batman mythology so far, and now Batman Beyond is next. 

                But while Murphy looks to the future, King will be looking to the past. As Comic Book Resources revealed Wednesday morning, King's next Batman tale will be Batman: Killing Time, with art by David Marquez and Alejandro Sánchez. A six-issue miniseries focusing on a younger Batman, the book will follow what happens when Catwoman, The Riddler, and The Penguin team up for "the greatest robbery in the history of Gotham City." This would put them in Batman's crosshairs no matter what their target was, but this time around, they're going after a secret artifact that belongs to none other than Bruce Wayne. What follows is an "action-packed tale of a young Batman desperate to recover his most prized possession."</p>

                    ALL TIME BEST SELLING
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Batman: The Black Mirror</p>
          <p> Writer: Scott Snyder </p>
            <p>  Artist: Jock and Francesco Francavilla </p>
           <p> Letterers: Todd Klein and Jared K. Fletcher </p>
          <p> A series of brutal murders pushes Batman's detective skills to the limit and forces him to confront one of Gotham City's oldest evils. Helpless and trapped in the deadly Mirror House, Batman must fight for his life against one of Gotham City's oldest and most powerful evils! Then, in a second story called "Hungry City," the corpse of a killer whale shows up on the floor of one of Gotham City's foremost banks. The event begins a strange and deadly mystery that will bring Batman face-to-face with the new, terrifying faces of organized crime in Gotham.
            Why Its Cool: Black Mirror is one of those perfectly-formed Batman stories that almost feels self-contained, and it’s probably my go-to pick from recent comics to hand to lapsed or new comics readers who have an interest in the character. It’s really got some of the foundational elements for modern takes on Batman at their finest, from detective work (which I’m hoping is something we see in the new film) to tinges of horror comics storytelling.
